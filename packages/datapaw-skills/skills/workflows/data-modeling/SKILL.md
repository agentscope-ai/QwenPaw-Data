name: data-modeling
description: Builds end-to-end predictive modeling pipelines on tabular datasets—data exploration, preprocessing, baseline modeling, and mandatory optimization—producing valid saved predictions in the required output format. Use for any supervised machine learning or data modeling task, including classification and regression on tabular data, Kaggle-style competitions or submission-file challenges, training a model to predict a target from features, or requests to fit/tune/evaluate models with scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and similar non-deep-learning methods. Runs fully automated end-to-end without asking the user for intermediate decisions.

# Data Modeling

When users present a data modeling request, start from data understanding and complete the full pipeline—from exploration to output. Run fully automated end-to-end; never pause to ask the user for intermediate decisions.

## Core Principles

- Strictly adhere to task requirements regarding features, preprocessing methods (if specified), and output format.
- All preprocessing parameters must be **fitted on the training set** and **consistently transformed on the test set**.
- Prioritize efficient methods and models from lightweight libraries like scikit-learn to quickly validate feasibility.
- Always consider data scale: for large sample sizes or high-dimensional features, implement OOM safeguards (e.g., sampling, streaming processing, avoiding full One-Hot encoding, limiting tree depth, etc.).
- Ensure outputs are well-structured and logically reproducible; avoid data leakage or dimension mismatches.
- 🚫 **No plotting allowed**: You cannot view charts. All feature analysis must be performed through **computed statistics only**.

## Data Exploration

Perform rapid preliminary analysis on the provided data:

- Check shape: number of samples and features.
- Identify feature types:
  - Numerical (continuous/discrete)
  - Categorical (nominal/ordinal)
  - Temporal (datetime)
  - Special fields: text, IDs, high-cardinality features, etc.

## Implementation Workflow

**Modeling Strategy: Start simple, iterate progressively.**

### ✅ Phase 1: Quick Baseline (Mandatory)

Use **simple, efficient methods and models** to establish an end-to-end pipeline and **generate an initial prediction**:

- **Essential Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values: impute with reasonable defaults (e.g., mean, median, mode) based on feature type.
  - Drop irrelevant columns: e.g., IDs, UUIDs, serial numbers, or other unique identifiers.
  - Encoding:
    - Numerical features: standardize if needed.
    - Categorical features:
      - **High-cardinality categories** (unique values ≥ 10): Avoid One-Hot encoding to prevent dimension explosion. Use compact representations such as Label Encoding, Frequency Encoding, Target Encoding, or Hash Encoding. **Choose the encoding method based on data characteristics and model compatibility.**
      - **Low-cardinality categories** (unique values < 10): One-Hot encoding may be acceptable, but evaluate total feature count—if many categorical columns exist, prefer low-dimensional alternatives to avoid feature inflation.

- **Model Construction**:
  - Select **computationally efficient, non-deep learning models** appropriate for data scale and complexity. Prefer lightweight, robust models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost with conservative settings).

- **Save Initial Predictions.**

### 🔁 Phase 2: Performance Insufficient? → Advanced Optimization (Mandatory)

Regardless of baseline performance, you **must automatically perform at least one effective optimization attempt**:

- **Determine optimization direction based on baseline results and task characteristics**:
  - Adopt more expressive or better-suited models.
  - Perform limited hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search over top 3 parameter combinations with cross-validation).
  - Feature engineering and selection, such as:
    - Remove clearly redundant or noisy features using importance scores or statistical metrics.
    - Apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) for high-dimensional sparse features.
    - Construct meaningful derived features (e.g., aggregates, interactions, binning, text length).

- **Evaluate the new model**:
  - If the new model performs better, use its predictions to overwrite the original submission file; otherwise, retain the baseline results.

- **Save Prediction Results**:
  - **After every modeling attempt, generate valid predictions and save output in the required format.**
  - **If later optimizations fail, fall back to and submit the baseline result; otherwise, replace it with the improved version.**

- **Principles**:
  - **Never** output prompts asking for user decisions (e.g., "Would you like to continue?", "Should I submit?"). The entire process must be fully automated end-to-end.
  - **Never** merely describe potential improvements (e.g., "We could try X") without actually executing the code.
  - **Never** skip optimization by claiming "performance is sufficient" without empirical validation.

> ⚠️ Always balance performance gains against implementation complexity: **Do not incur 10× maintenance cost for a 1% improvement.**
